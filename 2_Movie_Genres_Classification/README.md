## Approaches

### Deep Learning (DL)

In the DL approach, we employed advanced neural network architectures such as LSTM to extract intricate features from movie data. The DL model has demonstrated remarkable performance, achieving an accuracy of 94%. The high accuracy is attributed to the model's ability to capture complex patterns and relationships within the data.

For more details on the DL approach, refer to the `DL_Approach.ipynb` notebook.

### Machine Learning (ML)

In the ML approach, traditional machine learning algorithms were utilized to classify movie genres based on selected features. While the ML approach provided valuable insights, the accuracy reached 67%, indicating that the model might face challenges in capturing nuanced patterns present in the data.

For a deeper understanding of the ML approach, consult the `ML_Approach.ipynb` notebook.
